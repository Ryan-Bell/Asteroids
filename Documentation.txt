This version of asteroids was meant to look asthough you 
were flying around and attacking cells. At the same time,
I wanted to keep it simple which is why there are only 
two colors. The celluloid style is shown mainly in the 
behavoir of the asteroids which are drawn with curved
vertexs. At first, these vertices were drawn with bezier
points and then quadratic points, however, neither of 
those methods worked real well. The outside of the 'cells'
are animated with perlin noise as slight offsets whose
purpose is to make the 'cells' appear as though they are 
alive. The collision detection is accomplished with brute
force (looping through all of the asteroids and checking
them with the player and all of the non-hidden bullets),
although originally I was trying pixel based collision-
detection with loadPixels()/the pixels array. The pixel
based collision detection was not fast enough by any means.

Features include:
 - drifting motion
 - reuse of bullet object to avoid constant reinstantiation
 - a lifespan for the bullets
 - 'cells' that grow and eventually split on their own
 - curved vertexes
 - animated outer edges of 'cells'
